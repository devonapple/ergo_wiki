# Configuring wallet

Wallet configuration parameters worth paying attention to when configuring wallet for the first time:
* `ergo.wallet.seedStrengthBits` - the length of a seed in case it will be generated by the node. Note: the stronger the seed the longer the mnemonic sentence length is. Options: `128, 160, 192, 224, 256`
* `ergo.wallet.secretStorage.secretDir` - directory where secret will be stored in encrypted form
* `ergo.wallet.mnemonicPhraseLanguage` - language to be used in mnemonic sentence. Options: `"chinese_simplified", "chinese_traditional", "english", "french", "italian", "japanese", "korean", "spanish"`

# Using wallet for the first time
1. Wallet needs to be initialized when running for the first time. Two options are available here: 
    a. Initialize it from scratch (seed will be generated by the node) - POST, `/wallet/init`, 'body: {"pass": "123abc"}' (Note: don't forget to save mnemonic phrase the node will respond with)
    b. Restore wallet from existing seed. Choosing this option you have to provide your mnemonic phrase - POST, `/wallet/restore`, `body: {"pass": "123abc", "mnemonic": "abandon abandon ...", "mnemonicPass": "098cba"}` (Note: `mnemonicPass` field is required only in case your mnemonic phrase was protected by additional password at creation)
2. When wallet is initialized it needs to be unlocked - POST, `/wallet/unlock`, 'body: {"pass": "123abc"}'. (Note: use password you chosen at initialization stage)

Evaluate `2.` every time node is restarted or wallet is locked.
